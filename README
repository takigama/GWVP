GWVP - Mini Version
===================

ALPHA

Original I started GWVP as quite a large php project, then I got stalled with some 
problems and ultimately never really continued with it because I really needed to
start from scratch. However it was providing a service I ultimately wanted for
myself - an entirely web-based git reposity solution. So now i've started it again
and this time i've got a new set of code starting from a smaller beginning that 
will then expand over time as I work on it.

The current version "works", but its ugly as sin.

There is no install info at this point, but it will be coming soon.
