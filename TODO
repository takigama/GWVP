First (for beta release):

need a standard git log parser/collector deal
need to add activity for repo creation
get clone working properly
put "system'd" stuff into variables

Next:

ability to git-view a source code base?
Chat between people on the site - simplistic chat (or maybe just a simple form that'll send an email)

Long term:

link multiple sites together
deal with pull's between forks of a repo
